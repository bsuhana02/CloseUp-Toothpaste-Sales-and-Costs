# CloseUp-Toothpaste-Sales-and-Costs

Description
This dataset contains sales and cost information for various products under the CloseUp brand of toothpaste. It provides insights into the financial performance of each product variant, enabling analysis of profitability, sales trends, and cost management.
Data Structure
Columns:
Product: The name of the CloseUp toothpaste variant.
Sales: The total revenue generated from the sales of each product (measured in units sold or monetary value).
Costs: The expenses associated with each product, which may include production costs, marketing expenses, and distribution costs.
Rows: Each row represents a specific CloseUp product, providing its sales and cost figures.

In the "Products" worksheet, which outlines the sales, costs, and profit margins of the company's products, all figures are in INR. You are assigned the following tasks:

Determine the Profit Margin for Each Product: This requires calculating the margin generated by each product.
Set Up a Dropdown Menu: Create a dropdown menu in a designated cell that enables the selection of "Sales," "Costs," or "Margin." Ensure that these options are embedded directly into the menu without linking to other worksheet cells.
Use a Lookup Function to Display Values: Next to the profit margin column in the "Products" worksheet, utilize a lookup function to show the corresponding value for each product based on the selection made in the dropdown menu.
Create a Dynamic Chart: Develop a chart that visualizes the values (sales, costs, or margin) according to the selection made in the dropdown menu. The chart should automatically update to reflect changes in the selected option.
Organize and Format Data: Make sure the data is neatly arranged, using appropriate formatting to improve readability and give the worksheets a professional appearance.
